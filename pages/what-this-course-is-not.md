<!--
It is NOT a PHP course so we will not be teaching php basics here.

Leading into the next point, which is it is not for someone just starting out on their coding journey, I will be making some assumptions.

By not free code, I mean I will not give the repo because this is either for you to just watch, or to code with me so you can better learn. Frequent pausing is encouraged!
