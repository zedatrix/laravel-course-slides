The App directory has been reworked and simplified a lot!
Not necessarily in this order, but this is essentially the list of topics I plan to cover.
As I said earlier, this series is a WIP, so expect some potential changes.
I also love feedback, so if folks ask for stuff, I may change direction a little.
