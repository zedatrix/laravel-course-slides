# What You Will Walk Away With
- A working knowledge of Laravel
- A nice little CRM App
- Insights into Laravel best practices
- Confidence to go out and start building
- A couple of neat tricks

<!--
It is my hope that you will walk away with a basic understanding of the Laravel framework

The plan is to create a minmialistic CRM application that you can then extend as you wish, in your own way

I will try my best to adhere to the "laravel way" to make sure I don't lead you astray!

I hope you have the confidence to go out and start building your own laravel apps!

If nothing else, I hope you will have picked up a neat trick or two!
