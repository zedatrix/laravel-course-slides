# What this video series IS
- Laravel specific
- Intermediate level
- A refresher or introduction to the Laravel framework
- Free on YouTube
- A living WIP (Work in Progress)

<!--
I am not charging money for this course. It's going to be available for free on my YouTube channel. For LinkedIn, I will put a link to the channel in the post.

This is very laravel specific, and we will try to do things in the "laravel way"

I will be assuming that you already are familiar with the basic concepts of programming such as OOP and such.

This can be a refresher to watch through or to help you get caught up to work on your own laravel project.

This is a live series, which means it is ever evolving, I am continuing to make content for it.
When I deem the series to be finished, I will likely update this video to reflect that state.
